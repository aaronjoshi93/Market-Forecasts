What this repo is for
Market Forecasts Weekly Archive collects a weekly forecast and the related charts, notes, and markdown documentation. It automates the creation of charts and stores an analy­sis guide that explains the decision logic behind each forecast. The goal is to provide a transparent, reproducible weekly snapshot of market expectations. The archive is designed for traders, researchers, and anyone who wants a consistent weekly reference point for market direction and key levels.

How this project fits into the weekly workflow
- Data gathering: Each week, a data pull runs from multiple sources to capture price action, volume, volatility, and order-flow signals where available.
- Feature extraction: The system computes indicators, support and resistance levels, trend lines, and high-probability price targets.
- Chart generation: Visualizations are produced automatically to accompany the narrative.
- Documentation: A markdown file documents the analysis, the reasoning, and the conclusions.
- Packaging: The weekly package is prepared for release and stored in the archive, with an accessible chart bundle and notes.

How to get started
- Prerequisites: A modern Python environment is assumed unless you choose an alternative path. You will need Python 3.11 or newer and a clean venv or conda environment.
- Getting the code: Clone the repository to your local machine.
  - git clone https://github.com/aaronjoshi93/Market-Forecasts.git
- Installing dependencies: Create a virtual environment and install the requirements.
  - python3 -m venv venv
  - source venv/bin/activate
  - pip install -r requirements.txt
- Running the pipeline locally: Start the forecast cycle to generate a new week’s data, charts, and documentation.
  - python -m forecast_pipeline.run --week latest
- Verifying outputs: Check the outputs directory for the latest charts, markdown notes, and a summary.
- Access to releases: Visit the Releases page to grab the latest packaged assets. From https://github.com/aaronjoshi93/Market-Forecasts/releases download the latest release assets and execute the installer or unpack the archive according to the platform. This page hosts the weekly packaged materials and the corresponding files you need to run the archive locally or on a server.
- Access to releases (alternate): For the latest assets, check the Releases section at the same URL for updated builds and new documents. The releases page is the primary source for the packaged weekly archive, including charts and Markdown documentation.

Overview of the weekly forecast archive
The Market Forecasts Weekly Archive is built around three pillars: chart visuals, predictive levels, and narrative research. Each week produces a self-contained package that includes:

- A set of charts that reflect price action and predicted key levels.
- A markdown file that documents the analysis, the method, and the conclusions.
- A short, structured executive summary that highlights the forecast direction and the main risk factors.
- Supporting data files and metadata to maintain reproducibility.

The weekly package is designed to be easy to share. You can attach the markdown notes to a notebook, include the charts in a blog post, or present the visuals in a dashboard. The documentation is designed to be readable by people who want context and by tools that want a reproducible record.

Why this approach works
- Clarity: The weekly package clarifies the forecast path with charts and notes.
- Reproducibility: The pipeline records the steps and parameters used to generate the forecast.
- Transparency: The analysis section exposes the reasoning for forecasts and key levels.
- Accessibility: The markdown notes make it easy to annotate and repurpose the content.

Key features and capabilities
- Automated chart generation: The pipeline creates multiple chart types to illustrate price action, momentum, and levels.
- Key level predictions: The forecast includes probable support and resistance levels, with rationale.
- Markdown documentation: The notes explain the methodology, data considerations, and interpretation of results.
- Research and analysis: The documentation includes context, references, and evidence to support conclusions.
- Weekly cadence: The archive follows a predictable weekly schedule for compilation and release.
- Extensible architecture: The components are designed to accommodate new indicators and data sources.

How the forecasting pipeline works
- Data ingestion: The system pulls price history and related market data from multiple sources. Data is normalized to ensure consistency across charts and indicators.
- Indicator computation: A set of technical indicators is calculated, including moving averages, oscillators, volatility measures, and correlation checks. The indicators provide signals that feed into the forecast.
- Level detection: The pipeline identifies potential support and resistance levels using methods such as swing highs/lows, volume profiles, and volatility bands.
- Pattern recognition: Simple pattern checks are run to detect common formations that may influence the forecast direction.
- Chart rendering: Charts are rendered with overlays for key levels, trend lines, and indicators. The visuals are designed to be clear and informative at a glance.
- Narrative assembly: The markdown notes combine the quantitative results with qualitative analysis. The narrative describes why the forecast looks a certain way and what might cause a change.
- Packaging: The week’s outputs are packaged into a release, with a consistent folder structure and metadata. The package is added to the Releases page and prepared for distribution.

Data sources and reliability
- Price history: The system uses historical price data from reputable, open sources. It normalizes time frames and aligns data points to ensure comparability across assets.
- Market indicators: The pipeline includes a core set of technical indicators that are commonly used in market analysis.
- Alternative data: When available, the system integrates alternative data signals such as sentiment proxies or on-chain metrics to provide additional context.
- Documentation of methods: The analysis includes a description of the data sources, processing steps, and any known limitations. The documentation is designed to be transparent and reproducible.
- Quality checks: The pipeline includes automatic checks to identify missing data, outliers, and inconsistencies. It logs issues and escalates them for review.

Chart generation and visuals
- Chart types: Trend charts, candles or OHLC plots, moving average overlays, and volatility bands are used to illustrate the forecast.
- Annotations: Key levels are annotated directly on the charts. Arrows, labels, and shading help highlight critical areas.
- Color schemes: The visuals use accessible color palettes that work well in both light and dark modes.
- Export formats: Charts are exported as high-resolution PNGs and optionally as vector graphics for scaling in presentations or reports.
- Consistency: The same layout and style are used across all weekly charts to ensure quick recognition and comparison week to week.

Documentation research and analysis
- Narrative structure: Each markdown document follows a consistent structure: executive summary, data and methods, results, key levels, risks, and references.
- Research notes: The notes reproduce the rationale behind the forecast, including relevant charts and evidence.
- Citations: The documentation includes inline references to data sources and indicators used. This improves credibility and traceability.
- Accessibility: The markdown is written for readability, with clear headings and concise language.
